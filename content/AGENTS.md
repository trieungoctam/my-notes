# Wiki Schema

## Directory Structure
- sources/ - Document content. Short docs as .md, long docs as .json (per-page). Do not modify directly.
- sources/images/ - Extracted images from documents, referenced by sources.
- summaries/ - One per source document. Summary of key content.
- concepts/ - Cross-document topic synthesis. Created when a theme spans multiple documents.
- explorations/ - Saved query results, analyses, and comparisons worth keeping.
- reports/ - Lint health check reports. Auto-generated.

## Special Files
- index.md - Content catalog: every page with link, one-line summary, organized by category.
- log.md - Chronological append-only record of operations (ingests, queries, lints).

## Page Types
- **Summary Page** (summaries/): Key content of a single source document.
- **Concept Page** (concepts/): Cross-document topic synthesis with [[wikilinks]].
- **Exploration Page** (explorations/): Saved query results - analyses, comparisons, syntheses.
- **Index Page** (index.md): One-liner summary of every page in the wiki. Auto-maintained.

## Index Page Format
index.md lists all documents, concepts, and explorations with metadata:
- Documents: name, one-liner description, type (short|pageindex), detail access path
- Concepts: name, one-liner description
- Explorations: name, one-liner description

## Log Format
Each log entry: `## [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS] operation | description`
Operations: ingest, query, lint

## Format
- Use [[wikilink]] to link other wiki pages (e.g., [[concepts/attention]])
- Standard Markdown heading hierarchy
- Keep each page focused on a single topic
- Do not include YAML frontmatter (---) in generated content; it is managed by code

## Citation Conventions
- Concept pages include structured citations in YAML frontmatter
- Each citation has: book, pages, chapter, perspective
- Concept pages include 3-5 lowercase topic tags (e.g., ["methodology", "startups"])
- Concept pages have "## Sources & Perspectives" section comparing sources
- Multiple perspectives are compared and conflicts noted with blockquote callouts
- Query answers include inline [Source: [[summaries/doc-name]], pp.X-Y] citations

## Deep Study Sections
- Concept pages include active learning content as collapsible Obsidian callouts:
  - `> [!tip]- ELI5` - Simple explanation without jargon
  - `> [!tip]- Real-World Analogy` - Everyday analogy
  - `> [!warning]- Common Misconceptions` - Myths vs reality
  - `> [!question]- Check Your Understanding` - Q&A pairs
  - `> [!info]- Why It Matters` - Practical significance
- Questions use **Q:** and **A:** format for plugin parsing

## Tracking Fields (Concept Frontmatter)
- `understanding_level`: unreviewed | confused | partial | understood
- `last_reviewed`: ISO date or null
- `review_count`: integer
